    "# Working on a Linux cluster\n",
    "The exercises for this course (and all Data Science courses) are run on a server, which is a real computer in The Hague that you connect with through the network. By using this server, we can ensure that each student can use the same version of Python for running the code and thus reduce technical difficulties. Furthermore, we have a second server with a powerful GPU that is used for the advanced AI courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is an operating system like Windows or macOS, but open-source and used a lot for running servers. You don't need a lot of knowledge on Linux to complete the exercises of this course, but for some cases it's good to know some basic commands, specifically for when:\n",
    "- you accidentally remove or corrupt exercise file(s), and you want to reload these files.\n",
    "- you want to make your own code project, such as for the Rondje Delft project.\n",
    "- you want to setup a backup of your code using Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linux commands are typically run in a terminal (also called \"command line\"). You can access a terminal by pressing `File->New->Terminal` in the top-left. This will open a new terminal window to which you can switch. Try it out!"
