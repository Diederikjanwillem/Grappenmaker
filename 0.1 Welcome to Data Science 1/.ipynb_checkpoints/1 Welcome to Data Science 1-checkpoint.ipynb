    "Welcome to the course Data Science 1. Data Science is the study of data to extract meaningful information from this data. But the datasets are often too large and the models are too complex to do this on your own. So you need a computer to do the job. Programming is telling the computer what to do. Programming means writing lines of code which the computer can execute. It's a kind of 'computer language'. The computer can 'understand' this 'language' and will follow your 'orders'. There are different programming languages, one of them is Python. This course in an introduction to programming in Python.  \n",
